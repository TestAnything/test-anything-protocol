Abstract

   The Test Anything Protocol (TAP) is a protocol to allow communication
   between unit tests and a test harness.  It allows individual tests
   (TAP producers) to communicate test results to the testing harness in
   a language-agnostic way.  Tests can indicate success, failure, as
   well as mark tests as unimplemented or skipped, and to provide
   additional information to aid in debugging of failed tests.  Unlike
   other testing systems, it can indicate missing tests and duplicated
   tests.

   This specification defines TAP version 13.

Internet-Draft      The Test Anything Protocol (TAP)        October 2009


1.  Introduction

   The Test Anything Protocol (TAP) describes a standard format for
   testing suites to use.  This format provides both human and machine-
   readable information on which tests were run, whether they were
   successful or failed, as well as other information which might be
   useful in tracing the cause of the failure.  Being machine-readable
   allows this information to be easily parsed by an automated testing
   harness.  Test results may then be summarized and analyzed.  Being
   human-readable allows the results of a testing system to be read
   manually; this is useful for quickly determining whether individual
   tests pass and to aid in debugging the test system itself.

   TAP has been used by the Perl interpreter's test suite since 1987.

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The grammatical rules in this document are following ABNF and are to
   be interpreted as described in [RFC5234].

2.  Definitions

   Test:
         A piece of software which determines if a particular facility
         or component is functional.

   Test result:
         The encoding in TAP of the result of a single test.  It may
         have exactly one TAP result directive.

   Test set:
         Zero or more test results with exactly one plan.  A test set
         can be determined to have failed or passed.

   Test suite:
         A collection of test sets.

   TAP document:
         One test set which parses correctly as defined in this
         document.  Future expansion may allow multiple test sets to be
         contained in a single TAP document, allowing an entire test
         suite to be stored as a single TAP document.

   Plan:
         The number of tests which are expected to pass in a single test
         set.

   Directive:
         A directive changes the meaning of a test result; it is
         commonly used to indicate that a failing test should be
         reported as passing (TODO) or that a passing test should be
         tagged as suspicious (SKIP).

   Reason:
         A reason explains why a directive was necessary.

   Description:
         A description says what a test result is testing.

   Producer:
         A producer is a thing which can generate a valid TAP document.

   Consumer:
         A consumer is a thing which can parse and interpret a TAP
         document.

   Filter:
         A filter a piece of software which consumes a TAP document, and
         produces a new TAP document based in some way on the TAP input.
         For example, it can reproduce the TAP document exactly,
         normalize the formatting, combine multiple documents, or
         summarize the result of tests as a new TAP document.

3.  Producers and consumers

   A TAP document might exist as a file, data stream, encoded in another
   medium (stored in a PDF file, for instance) or in any other form
   which can be parsed as described below.  For maximum compatibility,
   it may be produced by any TAP producer, and must then be consumable
   by any TAP consumer.

   One example system of producers and consumers is the Test::More/
   Test::Harness system in Perl testing.  In this system, test producers
   are executable Perl scripts with a '.t' extension, collected in a
   number of folders, which themselves use the Test::More library to
   simplify testing.  These scripts can be executed individually, and
   emit TAP documents on standard output.

   A TAP consumer, such as the Perl module TAP::Parser, can interpret
   the output of a TAP producer to determine how many tests were run,
   which tests succeeded, and which diagnostic information might be
   usefully reported to the user.

   Note that these two processes are often decoupled.  The TAP document
   emitted by the TAP producer can be stored before being interpreted by
   the TAP parser; this allows all diagnostic and testing information to
   be stored for later analysis and usage.  The TAP document might be
   generated on one server, then downloaded to another before being
   processed.  A single TAP parser can be used to process files in all
   these cases, illustrating TAP's utility as a cross-language, cross-
   environment tool.

   The complete flow in this system can look something like this:

    ------------
    | Producer |
    ------------
        |
        V
    ----------------        -----------           --------------------
    | TAP document | --+--> | Storage |      +--> | Formatted Output |
    ----------------   |    -----------      |    --------------------
                       |         |           |
                       |         V           |
                       |    --------------   |    --------------------
                       +--> | TAP parser |---+--> | Test summaries   |
                            --------------        --------------------

   Additionally, utilities like "prove" can further simplify running a
   suite of TAP producers, by searching for files having certain
   characteristics or matching particular patterns.  For instance,

   conventionally, all tests for a Perl module are stored in the 't/'
   folder, and consist of executable scripts (TAP producers) with
   extensions of 't'.  The "prove" utility, part of the Test::Harness
   module, can then be used to find these files and run them all.  In
   the following example, prove executes t/error.t, t/id.t and t/url.t
   and evaluates the produced TAP documents in turn, checking which ones
   passed and failed, and providing a complete summary of the entire
   test suite run.

   $ prove t/*.t
   t/error.t...ok
   t/id.t......ok
   t/url.t.....ok
   Result: PASS

4.  The Structure of a TAP document

   A TAP test set consists of one version, one plan, zero or more test
   results, and any number of comments and ignored elements.  A TAP test
   set is split into lines, separated by newline characters.  Any line
   beginning with the letters 'ok' or 'not ok' is a test result.  All
   unparsable lines must be ignored by TAP consumers.  In order to keep
   TAP readable on the system on which it is produced, the end-of-line
   character for TAP may be LF or CRLF.  The same end-of-line character
   must be used throughout a document.

   Free-form strings in TAP, such as reasons and descriptions, must be
   in UTF8 unless the interchange parties agree otherwise.  Strings MUST
   NOT contain an EOL or NUL character.  Since directives start with a
   "#" and come after a description, descriptions MUST NOT contain a
   "#".

4.1.  Version

   Every test set as defined in this document should contain a version
   definition.  A test set without a version definition is assumed to be
   written in TAP version 12, which is not covered by this document.

4.2.  Plan

   Every test set should contain one and only one plan.  A test set
   containing multiple plans can be parsed as a TAP document, but will
   be judged to have failed.

4.3.  Test results

   A test result reports the status of one single test.  The test must
   summarize itself as passing ("ok") or failing ("not ok"), and must
   have a test number.  A test result without an explicit test number
   will be assumed to have the next number in increasing numeric
   sequence from the start of the test set.  A test result can also have
   a description and a directive, which modifies the meaning of the
   test, but both are optional.

   Test results must be present in the correct order, without missing
   tests or duplicate test numbers, for the test set to be judged to
   pass.

4.4.  Bail Out

   A Bail-Out line indicates a gross failure in the TAP producer.
   Results from this test set can no longer be trusted.  The TAP
   consumer should ignore the rest of the TAP syntax and may terminate



Vaidya & Schwern           Expires May 2, 2010                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft      The Test Anything Protocol (TAP)        October 2009


   the TAP producer if it can do so safely.  If processing multiple
   files, the TAP consumer should stop processing other files which are
   part of the same test suite.

4.5.  Comments

   Comments are lines which have no meaning in TAP.  They do not alter
   the result of a test.  A TAP document with and without comments has
   exactly the same meaning.

   Comments typically contain debugging information.  TAP consumers
   should not display comments by default, as there will likely be a
   large number of tests in such a suite.

   Note that TAP does not provide a mechanism for comments to be
   associated with particular test results; for instance, comments of a
   general nature might be interspersed with comments specific to a
   particular test.

4.6.  Ignored elements

   In order to allow extension of the protocol while maintaining
   backwards compatibility, a TAP consumer must ignore certain lines and
   elements.  Any line which does not parse must be ignored.  Any
   directive or plan-directive which is not recognized must also be
   ignored.

   Here's an example of a TAP stream which contains ignored elements.

   1..2                # Line 1
   Error at line 12    # Line 2
   ok 1                # Line 3
   ok 2 # BANG         # Line 4

   Line 2 should be ignored, it does not parse.  The directive "BANG" on
   test #2 should be treated as an ordinary comment, it is not a TAP
   directive.

5.  Grammar

   The test set is defined below using Augmented Backus-Naur Form
   (ABNF), as defined in [RFC5234].

6.  Passing and Failing

   Both test sets and test results can be determined to have passed or
   failed as detailed below.  Note that a test set might fail even if
   every single test result contained in it passes.

6.1.  Test results

   A test result indicates whether the test it reports has passed ("ok")
   or failed ("not ok").  It is itself said to pass or fail, depending
   on the result of the underlying test and on any directives applied to
   that result.  It can be modified with any of the directives listed
   below.  The table below summarises how directives can change a test
   result.

   +--------+------------+---------------------------+-----------------+
   |        |     No     |            TODO           |       SKIP      |
   |        | directives |                           |                 |
   +--------+------------+---------------------------+-----------------+
   | ok     |    pass    |            pass           |       pass      |
   |        |            | (optionally with warning) |                 |
   |        |            |                           |                 |
   | not ok |    fail    |            pass           |       fail      |
   |        |            |                           |  (with warning) |
   +--------+------------+---------------------------+-----------------+

                  Test results as modified by directives

6.2.  The "SKIP" directive

   This directive indicates that the test was not begun.  Usually this
   is caused by environmental reasons: a missing optional library, an
   operating specific test, or an expensive test that is only run on
   request.

   Since the test was skipped, the test result is expected to be "ok"
   (indicating that the test was skipped correctly).  A skipped test
   with a result of "not ok" is suspicious, and the TAP consumer should
   report a warning.

6.3.  The "TODO" directive

   This directive indicates that the test was run, but failure is
   expected and should not cause the test set to fail.  This is usually
   because the functionality being tested has not been completely
   implemented or is obstructed by a known bug.

   Neither a failing nor a passing TODO test will cause the test set to



Vaidya & Schwern           Expires May 2, 2010                 [Page 12]

Internet-Draft      The Test Anything Protocol (TAP)        October 2009


   fail, but since passing TODOs are suspicious, they may optionally be
   reported by TAP consumers.

6.4.  Plan

   The plan indicates the number of tests which are expected to be run
   in the current test set.  Two types of plans are defined, with
   different requirements for passing:

   1.  A simple plan: the number of expected tests must be a positive
       integer.  In order for a test set with a simple plan to pass, it
       must contain exactly the number of test results indicated in the
       plan, in ascending numeric order, without either any gaps in test
       number or any duplicate tests.  Every test result must pass.

   2.  A skip-all plan: the number of expected tests is zero.  A test
       set with a skip-all plan passes unless it contains any test
       results.

   Allowing simple plans to plan for zero tests is being considered, but
   is not a part of this specification.

6.5.  Other factors

   TAP consumers may use any other system-specific factors to determine
   whether a test set passes or fails.  If such a failure is to be
   reported, it MUST inform the user of the state of the TAP parsing and
   whether all tests appear to have passed, and then must separately
   describe the nature of the system-specific failure which caused the
   consumer to become suspicious of the results.

   TAP consumers which also act as TAP producers could add additional
   test results to the end of the output TAP document if such a failure
   occurs.  For instance, take a TAP producer which emits ten successful
   tests, then throws an exception and exits with a failure.  A filter
   might add a new (11th) failing ("not ok") test result to the end of
   the TAP it emits, which informs the user of the exception or failure
   exit code.  Note that such a test result would cause the test set to
   fail; unless the test set planned one more test than it emitted, the
   number of tests would not equal the number of tests planned; even if
   it did this, this 11th failing test would cause the test set to fail.

   An example of the use of this option is to check exit codes of TAP
   producers for a failure, which might indicate that the producer
   failed after having emitted a complete TAP document.  It seems
   unpragmatic to ignore such exit codes, but this information cannot be
   reliably expressed into its own TAP output by a failing producer, and
   must be treated separately.  This also allows for language-specific

   and system-specific features to be used by the TAP consumer at its
   discretion to improve the rigour of its testing.

7.  Security Considerations

   A parser which stores test results in a dynamically sized array may
   be vulnerable to memory starvation by a test which uses a very high
   test number.  For example:

   1..3
   ok 1
   ok 2
   ok 123456789

   The above test result would cause an array of 123456789 elements to
   be allocated.  So it is recommended that test results, if stored at
   all, are stored in a sparse array.

   This document is based on Andy Armstrong's description of the TAP
   protocol, version 13, which is itself based on Andy Lester's
   description of the TAP protocol, version 1.00.  The basis for the TAP
   format was created by Larry Wall in the original test script for
   Perl 1.  Tim Bunce and Andreas Koenig developed it further with their
   modifications to the Test::Harness module.
